<p>Hi my name is Diana
<br />
I am half way through my 200 hour yoga teacher training with Yoga Alliance Professionals (YAP). 
<br />
I have started to put my knowledge into practice by offering small down to earth beginners yoga classes at reduced rates above Ronnies on the Belmont Road, East Belfast. 
<br />
I also offer small private group sessions. Check out my class schedule below for current classes or drop me a message.
